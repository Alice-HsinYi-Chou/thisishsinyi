//recommended file size and type for logo, answer from claude
For logos in web development, here are the recommended specifications:
File Types:

SVG (Preferred)

Scalable Vector Graphics
Perfect for logos as it's resolution-independent
Typically very small file size (2-10KB)
Best for simple, flat designs
Can be animated and styled with CSS

PNG (Alternative)

Use when SVG isn't feasible
Supports transparency
Recommended sizes:

Header logo: 250-400px wide, under 100KB
Favicon: 32x32px, 16x16px, and 64x64px
Mobile: 160-200px wide
Social media/sharing: 1200x630px (but keep under 300KB)
Best Practices:

Keep SVG logos under 15KB if possible
For PNG logos, aim for under 100KB for large versions
Provide multiple sizes for different contexts (mobile, desktop, social)
Consider creating a sprite sheet if using multiple logo variants
Include both light and dark versions if needed
Use compression tools like SVGO for SVG or TinyPNG for PNG

Additional Tip:
Consider creating a logo system with:

Full logo (with text)
Symbol only (for favicon/small spaces)
Horizontal and vertical layouts
Light and dark variants

Would you like me to explain any of these aspects in more detail?
